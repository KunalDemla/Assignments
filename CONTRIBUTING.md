* All directories/files under `Major - Degree/Sem <Sem-Number>/<Subject Code>` must follow same convention (of your language choice).
* In case of Same Subject Code / Assignments previously uploaded, add a `symbolic link / hard link / Shortcut` to the previously done assignment.
* In case of no availble Assignments to commit, Add a FunFact to HacktoberCommit.md or Add any usefull resource avaialble in `Extra Resources`, with an apropriate directory structure.
